## Disclaimer
The page is in french (sorry :p)
Little webgame similar to a worlde where you guess a random - french - word (between 5 and 9 letters).
Small issue with the current status of the game is that you can easily cheat by console.log() the variable corresponding to the word to guess. I have not thought about this part when starting the project.
Also the page is not entirely finished (the 3 buttons on the footer open an empty pop up for now).

## Game rules
You have 6 tries to find the random word. Every word tried will begin with the first letter of the word to find.
If a letter matches perfectly with a letter in the word to find (value and position in the word), it will be displayed in red.
If a letter is misplaced it will be displayed in yellow.
